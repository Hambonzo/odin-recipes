    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Soak your dried shallots</h3> <p>in a bowl or container, add in your dried shallots. Pour over water and soak your
        shallots, for 4 hours to overnight in the fridge, not exceeding 24 hours. We need to rehydrate the dried
        shallots, so we will place overnight in water to do so. If you’re in a pinch, just do it 4-5 hours before.</p>

        <h3>Dry and dice your shallots</h3>  <p>Once they’re soft and soaked, rinse and dry completely with a paper towel. Finely
        dice your dried shallots and place in a medium bowl.</p> 
        
        <h3>Make the dip</h3>
        <p>In the same bowl, add in your yogurt, salt, pepper, dried mint and we’re adding a pinch of cumin as well but
        that’s totally optional. Mix well. Serve now, or you can store in the fridge for later.</p>
        <h3>Garnish and serve</h3> <p> with fresh mint, a little dried mint as well, and edible flowers (optional). Serve with
        your favorite veggies or bread of choice (we’re using toasted sangkak!)</p>
